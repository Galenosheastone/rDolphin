Description: Dolphin is an R package that performs the automatic profiling of 1H 1D spectra of all biofluids and outputs several indicators of quality of quantification and identification of signal. The package incorporates a Shiny GUI that eases the use of the program by researchers with non-expert programming skills. Dolphin performs supervised automatic profiling of 1H 1D NMR Spectra. Dolphin subdivides the spectrum in Regions of Interest (ROIs) with characteristic signals for each biofluid. The correct parameters for each ROI for each dataset can be changed if necessary before performing an automatic profiling.The Shiny GUI is especially prepared to help during the parameter choice process. Dolphin comes with tools to load individual quantifications to be evaluated and optimized. Dolphin can also perform different kinds of analysis of the generated data.License: GPL (>= 2)
