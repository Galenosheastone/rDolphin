\arguments{
\item{final_output}{List with quantifications and indicators of quality of quantification.}

\item{alarm_matrix}{List of previous indicators.}

\item{validation_type}{Type of validation to perform (1: fitting error, 2: signal total area ratio, 3: difference expected-obtained chemical shift, 4: difference expected-obtained half bandwidth, 5: difference expected-obtained intensity)}
}
\value{
List with estimated indicators, matrix to show in GUI, and breaks and colors to prepare a different color for each cell of the matrix.
